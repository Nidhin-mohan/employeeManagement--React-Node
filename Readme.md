# Employee Management app

This is an employee management app built using React and Node with TypeScript. The app uses lists to store data and makes use of the PnPjs library to communicate with the SharePoint lists. The PnPjs library provides a plug and play approach to manage dependencies, making it easier to work with SharePoint.
